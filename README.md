# Entropy-and-Gini-Calculator
- This implementation includes Gini Index and Gain Index Entropy calculator.

# Entropy:
- Entorpy calculates to find Gain Index in Artificial Intelligent. Entropy has a formula that hard to implements in a short time so this calculator makes the calculation easier.

Entropy Formula:

Gain Formula:

# Gini Index:
- Gini Index is a method that uses to decrease number of attribute for the data impurity. Gain also has calculation that not easy to calculate every single time. So this code helps you to find Gini short way. It is not shorter way but helps you to decrease number of calculation.
